  Move beyond RPA and experience the power of APA with ENIGMA2.0, 
  a software solution that adapts, scales, and evolves with you. 
  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the use of software â€œrobots" who perform the same way every time and don't learn from one repetition to another. 
  AI Process Automation in Enigma first learns your business processes (acquiring information), 
  improves them (using context and rules) and finally, 
  performs intelligent internal self-correction (learning from successes and failures) to enable immediate action
