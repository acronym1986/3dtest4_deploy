  Move beyond RPA and experience the power of APA with ENIGMA2.0, 
  a software solution that adapts, scales, and evolves with you. 
  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the use of software â€œrobots" who perform the same way every time and don't learn from one repetition to another. 
  AI Process Automation in Enigma first learns your business processes (acquiring information), 
  improves them (using context and rules) and finally, 
  performs intelligent internal self-correction (learning from successes and failures) to enable immediate action

  For years, we've consulted alongside our customers to build our Artificial Intelligence platform backwards, 
  starting from solving the mission critical enterprise problems. 
  Our goal is to provide the world's most seamless experience for working with real-time data, 
  one that enables people to gain rich insights into their dynamic environment. 
  To achieve this, we create intelligent platform products that unlock the value of big data by layering industry-preferred applications on top of a fully integrated human augmented and machine-assisted analysis 
  Responsible Ai To build trust, 
  it's critical that AI systems should operate reliably, safely, and consistently. 
  It should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, 
  and resist harmful manipulation, especially in the hands of third-party organisations. 
  When AI systems help inform decisions that have tremendous impacts on people's lives, 
  it's critical that people understand how those decisions were made. The stakeholders can then identify potential performance issues, 
  fairness issues, exclusionary practices, or unintended outcomes. 
  We are committed to delivering Responsible AI solutions through reproducible and automated workflows by keeping humans in the loop to assess fairness, explainability, error analysis, 
  and performance. With our products, make real-life interventions with causal analysis in the responsible AI dashboard and generate a scorecard at deployment time. 
  Contextualise responsible AI metrics for both technical and non-technical audiences to involve stakeholders and streamline compliance review.
